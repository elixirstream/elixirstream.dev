To start your Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Ensure you have [silicon](https://github.com/Aloxaf/silicon) installed and in your `$PATH`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
  * You'll need to supply GitHub and Twitter OAuth tokens for the app to be
      meaningful.
  * Local environments are configured out-of-the-box to connect to Postgres on
      port 54321. You can set this up by running `docker-compose up -d`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
